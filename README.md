# Rick and Morty - Conexa Challenge

## Description

When you first enter the game, you'll see a list of characters displayed in two sections you can scroll to.
To choose a character, simply click on their card in either section. Once you select a character from each section, you'll be able to see the list of episodes they appear in.
There will be a display of episodes that each character appears in. The episodes will be listed separately for each character.
If the selected characters appear in the same episode, it will be listed under a "Shared Episodes" section. This section will show you which episodes both characters are present in together.
You can always go back to the character selection and you can select different characters to explore their episodes and see if they share any with other characters.
